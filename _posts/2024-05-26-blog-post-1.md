Recently, I read some papers about Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), which is quadratically faster than the classical Monte Carlo method. However, the efficiency of QMC largely depends on the probability loading process, which encodes the desired probability distribution in the superposition of quantum states. Since the inverse transformation is a common used technique in classical computation, I wonder if it can be used in the probability loading process. Here is a way I come up with, [Probability loading via inverse transformation](https://github.com/dddddddk/DongDekuan/blob/25ce0a51c583e61e53baeda178cf65d4b3d2204b/files/Probability_Loading_via_Inverse_Transformation.pdf).
